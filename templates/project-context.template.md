# [Project Name] — Project Context

## Project Map

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/` | [Main application source — describe here] |
| `docs/` | Architecture, deployment, and system docs |
| `tests/` | Test suites |
| `data/` | [Runtime state / user data — if applicable] |
| `.github/` | Agent behavior rules and project adapter |

## Canonical Docs

| Doc | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Project entry point |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | [System architecture — create if needed] |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Phase planning and acceptance targets |
| `session_state.md` | Cross-session state |
| `docs/INDEX.md` | TYPE-A doc navigation index |

## Task Recovery Sequence

1. Read this file
2. Read `docs/INDEX.md`
3. Read the canonical doc for the active topic (see triggers below)
4. Read the actual code/config files to be touched
5. If cross-session: read `session_state.md`

## Critical Topic Triggers

<!-- Add rows matching your project's topic surface -->
<!-- Pattern: keyword (partial match is fine) → doc to load -->

| Trigger keywords | Canonical doc |
|---|---|
| `network\|port\|proxy\|connectivity` | `docs/NETWORK_GUIDE.md` |
| `architecture\|design\|service boundary` | `ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| `roadmap\|phase\|milestone` | `ROADMAP.md` |
| `[your topic]` | `[your doc path]` |

## Build and Test Commands

```bash
# Replace with actual project commands

# Type check
# pyright .

# Run tests
# pytest tests/

# Lint
# ruff check .

# Build
# npm run build

# Start
# ./scripts/start.sh
```

## Protected Paths

<!-- Explicit user confirmation required before: delete, clear, overwrite, replace -->

| Path | Why protected |
|---|---|
| `data/` | Runtime state — irreversible if deleted |
| `.env` | Secrets — append preferred over overwrite |
| `[add more]` | [reason] |

## Runtime Config Locations

| Location | What it controls |
|---|---|
| `.env` | Environment-level overrides |
| `[config file path]` | [what it controls] |

## Dangerous Operations Policy

- `data/` → explicit confirmation required before any destructive operation
- `.env` → do not overwrite wholesale
- [Add project-specific entries]

## Notes

<!-- Add environment-specific notes: venv activation, service pre-checks, etc. -->
